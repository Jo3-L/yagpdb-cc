# Role commands
This is a collection of custom commands that relate to role giving and removing

## add_additional_role_on_message_react.cc.lua
This command can be used to give the user a role when they react to a message. It works well with an existing rolemenu if you want to give a user multiple roles when they select an option from the rolemenu (for example, giving them a role category such as 'Teams' when they select one or multiple teams from a role menu).

## send_message_on_message_react.cc.lua
This command can be used to send a message to a channel when they react to a message. It works well with an existing rolemenu if you want to send a message to a channel to welcome a user who has just received a role.
