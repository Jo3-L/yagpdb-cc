# XP System
These commands are **not** standalone. Add all the commands if you wish to use it. No configuration is needed, settings are done via commands.

As usual, there is a README.md file in each folder showing the trigger and description of the CC, as well as other useful information

## Functionality
* Role rewards (one per level, up to 200 from level 1 to 200)
* Two types of role rewards (stack, and highest, explained more)
* Source is easy to read (indented, commented with leading comment in each "command" to explain that command)
* Paginated leaderboard
* Utilizes DB system
* Allows you to set xp and level easily
* Get started with 1 command, no editing of source needed

## Getting Started
Copy the minified versions of each commands in the folder, add them with the instructions given in the README.md in that command's folder, and run `-leveling use-default` to get started with the default settings!
