# Maintenance CCs
These commands are all standalone (you can pick and choose which commands to add).
Most of these commands are helpful for maintenance (editing messages from YAGPDB, sending new messages, etc.)

As usual, there is a README.md for each command folder showing the trigger and description of the CC, as well as other important information.
