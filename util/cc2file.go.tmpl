	This command sends your CC code in a text file, rather than "plain" Discord messages, preserving Tabs, markdown, etc. 
	If input ID is invalid (i.e. CC doesn't exist), bot will send a message listing all CCs (usual `-cc` output)
	
	Usage: `-cc2file <ID_of_CC>`. For example: `-cc2file 10`
	Recommended trigger: Command trigger with trigger `cc2file`.
	Configuration variables: None
