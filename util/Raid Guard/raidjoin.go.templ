{{/*
	Trigger: member join
	This code is to be placed in the "Join message in server channel" section.

	About: This trigger will track all incomming users to the server, and will add a user to the "raidlist" if their account is younger than 1 day. The list expires
	every 10 minutes, to allow for a refresh, if some users are not part of a raid.
