## Contributing

If you spot an error, feel free to make a PR or open an issue. If you wish to add your own command, feel free to make a PR as well. Note that not all CCs PRed will be added; merging is up to maintainers. Don't take it personally if your PR didn't make it through - we only accept custom commands that we feel will be useful to many people.

_If you are adding a new CC, please read the [guidelines](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). We don't have too many hard-and-fast conventions in place other than some about documentation._
